# Introduction

The richest man in babylon is of the best books on financial advices that I have come across. It is surprising that the principles that the book mentions are still valid and practical. I feel this is because the psychology is still the same just that earlier it was gold but now the instruments have increased.

# Learnings

## Chapter 1

The book starts with few friends discussing and talking about their financial problems and how even after working for years they have not been able to become rich and just striving for existence. On the other hand, their friend Arkat became the richest man in the Babylon kingdom. They meet Arkat and ask him to help them to become rich and he shares following insights:-

- If one has not acquired more than a bare existence every after years of hard-work it is because either one has failed to learn the laws that govern the building of wealth or else failed to observe them.
- If one takes advice regarding finances from someone who is not experienced then one shall pay with savings for proving the falsity of their opinions.
- If one learns to acquire money, to keep and to then how to use it then one becomes rich and wealth grows in ways that no man can prophesy the limit of it.
- Opportunity will never wait for someone who is unprepared.
- Willpower is whimsical and changes each day based on body chemistry but discipline and focusing on task at hand is the way to get rich. One must make up his mind that if he has to do a task he will complete it till the end.
- **A part of all you earn is yours to keep**

## Chapter 2

In this chapter the king of Babylon asks the richest man Arkat to share the wisdom with rest of the men in the kingdom so that they grow financially. Arkat extending on the first chapter shares following 7 points and they are really really interesting as well as simple

- One should save 1/10 of his income and put them aside as savings. 
- In order to save 1/10 of his income one should reduce the expenditure and buy things that are necessary.
- One should put 1/10 money saved to work. In the modern era this can be putting the money to generate assets like real estate, gold, stock, etc. 
- Extending on the point 3 one should safeguard the saved amount from losses. In the modern era this includes schemes like quick rich, immediate unrealistic returns etc.
- One should make a profitable investment towards owning a home
- One should plan for the future on how to manage finances when one is old
- One should continuously be willing to learn and acquire new skills to make money money

## Chapter 3

In this chapter the people discuss about how much of a role the luck plays in financial journey.

- One has to understand that all the time he might not be rewarded and their will be times where his efforts will be defeated. Yet with persistence profit is soon realized.

- Places like casino/gambling are always against the man and those places should be avoided and if done should be done with as minimum amount as possible

- Adding to the above point based on my personal observation one should always take risks in investment according to the possible winning odds/probability. If the probability is more than 0.6 then taking the risk is worth the effort

- Luck always favors the right choice and not before it. It is always important to take advantage of the opportunities and good luck can be enticed by accepting opportunity.

- If we finds a good deal it is wise to make the payment and close it immediately. 

- To get good luck one has to perform the action first. Men of action are favored by the goddess of good luck. 

## Chapter 4

In this chapter laws of making money are shared with quite an interesting example. Also it shares some deep insights on the right way of parenting. Arkat asks his son to first prove his worth to inherit his wealth and gives him a time of 10 years. If after 10 years he is not able to do so Arkat will donate all his wealth to the priest. This was quite against the babylon culture as the expectation is for the child to inherit the parent's wealth. Also, as a parent it was quite a hard call as a father mainly because it is quite hard to see one's child go through hardship.

The laws of the gold are as follows

- Use a minimum of 1/10 of the earnings to create an estate for future and family.
- Employ the savings to generate their child and then grandchild. Make the money work.
- Be wary about the recommendation/advice on how and where to put money
- Never invest in business or purpose that is not familiar or not approved by people who are skilled in its keep
- Immediate unexpected returns/schemes, romantic desires etc. would make the money flee the man. Wealth that comes quickly goes the same way.


Also an interesting insight that without wisdom, money is quickly lost by those who have it. If given a choice between gold and wisdom one should choose wisdom because gold can be earned if one has necessary skills.
